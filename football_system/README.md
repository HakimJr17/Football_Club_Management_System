# Local Football Club Management System
## Project Overview
  This is an API-driven solution designed to digitize and centralize the management of a local football club's day-to-day operations. It provides a secure, role-based system for managing key data and business logic, which will serve as the foundation for a future front-end application.

## Problem Statement
  A local football club lacks a centralized, secure, and user-friendly system to manage its day-to-day operations. This results in disorganized record-keeping, inefficient communication, and limited access to critical information for different team members.

## The Solution
  1. This API provides a robust, back-end system to address these challenges by:
  
  2. Securely Managing Records: It handles all essential club data, including players, matches, equipment, training sessions, and financial records (incomes and expenses).
  
  3. Implementing Role-Based Access Control: It uses a fine-grained permissions system to ensure each user—whether a team manager, captain, coach, or club secretary—can only access and modify the data relevant to their specific role.
  
  4. Providing a User-Friendly API: The API is designed to be intuitive and easy for a front-end application to consume. It uses human-readable names for creating and updating records, and returns clear, well-structured JSON responses.

## Key Features
  1. Player & Team Management: Create, view, update, and delete player profiles.
  
  2. Match & Training Session Tracking: Record and manage match results and training attendance.
  
  3. Equipment Assignments: Track and assign equipment to individual players.
  
  4. Financial Record-Keeping: Log and track all club incomes and expenses.
  
  5. Secure Permissions: A custom permissions system ensures data security and proper access for all users.

## API Endpoints
The API is built using Django and Django REST Framework. The following are the main endpoints:

  1. /api/players/
  
  2. /api/matches/
  
  3. /api/assignments/
  
  4. /api/incomes/
  
  5. /api/expenses/
  
  6. /api/training-sessions/
  
  The API also includes endpoints for managing supporting data like equipment, roles, and profiles.

## Getting Started
  To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
  You'll need a few things installed on your computer to get started.
  
  Python 3: This project is built using Python.
  
  pip: The package installer for Python.
  
  Git: A version control system to clone the project.

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the Repository: First, download the project files from GitHub to your local machine.

  git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)

2. Navigate into the new project directory:

  cd your-repo-name

3. Create a Virtual Environment: It's a best practice to create an isolated environment for your project's dependencies.

  python -m venv venv

4. Activate the Virtual Environment:

  On Windows:
  
  venv\Scripts\activate
  
  On macOS and Linux:
  
  source venv/bin/activate

5. Install Dependencies: Install all the required Python libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.

  pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Run Migrations: Django needs to create the database tables for your models.

  python manage.py migrate

7. Create a Superuser: This will allow you to access the Django admin site to manage data.

  python manage.py createsuperuser

  Follow the prompts to set up your username, email, and password.

8. Run the Development Server: Finally, start the server to access the API.

  python manage.py runserver

  Your API should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. You can access the API endpoints and the Django Admin site from your browser or a tool like Postman.

## Future Work
  1. Develop a front-end UI to interact with the API.

  2. Implement authentication and user registration endpoints.

  3. Add notifications and reporting features.
